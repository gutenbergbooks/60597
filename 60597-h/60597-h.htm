<p>No other branch of the Federal Government furnishes
employment to so many men as the postal service,
particularly that branch of it in which letter
carriers and clerks are used. In every city vacancies
occur frequently, by reason of death, resignation or
transfer, and the prospects of employment are always
good for intelligent young men of studious habits. To
secure an appointment in the postal service, as in other
fields of labor, one must prove his fitness for the job
desired. Uncle Sam requires that this shall be done
in an open competitive examination, and usually there
are hundreds, in the large cities thousands, competing
in the same examinations. Taking New York City
as an example, the annual appointments to each position
average between 200 to 300, while the eligible lists
usually contain 1,000 to 1,500 each. From this it will
be seen that only a small percentage stand any show of
appointment. Those that do succeed are the men
who took pains to prepare themselves for the test by a
careful study of the subjects required. The purpose of
this book is to help the candidate to “brush up,” to
direct him in self-improvement, and point the way by
which any person of ordinary intelligence, willing to
devote his leisure moments to study, can pass a good
examination and get within striking distance on the
eligible list.</p>

<span class="fs90 bold">CRADLE DAYS OF THE POSTAL SERVICE.</span></h2>


<p>No Branch of the federal government more strikingly
illustrates the wonderful growth and extension
of Uncle Sam’s business than the Postal Service. Its
history is the history of the commercial and industrial
development of the nation, for it has kept abreast, so
far as supplying the means of quick and reliable communication
is concerned, of the onward march of progress.
It ought to be the desire and the aim of every
man and woman who purposes to take up the postal
service as a life career, to know something of its history,
its gradual evolution. Only in this way can they
form a just estimate of its relative value in the scheme
of government, and without such knowledge they will
be merely perfunctory human machines, void of that
close personal attachment so necessary to success in
any undertaking.</p>

<p>A review of the history of the postal service in
America has all the interest and charm of an old
romance dealing with the life and customs of a bygone
age, particularly when depicted by one whose
heart and soul is wrapped up in the service, by one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
whose career in itself is the best proof of what studious
habits, devotion to duty, and loyalty to the department
can do for a man in the postal service. That
man is Edward M. Morgan, Postmaster of New York
City, who, starting as a letter-carrier in 1873, came up
through the ranks, grade by grade, until he was entrusted
with the management of one of the two largest
post offices in the world.</p>


<h3>Beginning of the Postal Service.</h3>

<p>Mr. Morgan in speaking of the history of the postal
service says:</p>

<p>“The post office played but a minor part in the early
affairs of New Amsterdam. For many years after the
consummation of the greatest real estate deal on
record, which secured from the Indians the whole
island of Manhattan for twenty-four dollars, most of
the slight correspondence that was carried on was forwarded
in the care of chance travelers, or mutual
friends of the correspondents. Later the necessity of
some sort of receiving place was felt and what was
known as the “Coffee House Delivery” came into use.
Letters were addressed to some popular coffee house
or tavern, where, upon receipt, they were “posted” in
a conspicuous place in the public room where they remained
until by chance or gossip, the persons for
whom they were intended learned of their arrival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>


<h3>New York’s First Post office.</h3>

<p>“That system in time came to be regarded as unsatisfactory,
and in 1692, when New York, as it had
then come to be called, was still a quiet village of
about five thousand <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'inhabitants. The'">inhabitants, the</ins> village authorities
passed an act or ordinance establishing a post
office. This was followed by the founding here, in
1710, of a “Chief Letter Office” by the Postmaster-General
of Great Britain, shortly afterwards, arrangements
were made for the delivery of mail from Boston
twice a month, and propositions were advertised
for the establishment of a post to Albany. The interesting
feature of that advertisement, to us who are
accustomed to the speedy locomotion of to-day, was
that the mail was not to be carried by coach, or boat,
or even on horseback, but on foot. The records are
hazy as to the location of the first official post office
in New York City, but according to an advertisement
that appeared in a paper of the period, it was removed
in 1732 from the quarters it then occupied to “the
uppermost of the two houses on Broadway, opposite
Beaver Street.” The year 1753 found it still in the
same location. It was closed on Sundays, and at other
times it was open for business from 8 A. M. until noon,
excepting on post nights, when business was transacted
until 10 P. M.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>


<h3>Annual Postal Receipt Less Than $3,000.</h3>

<p>“In 1786, during the administration of Sebastian
Bauman, the second postmaster after the close of the
War of the Revolution, there was a regular schedule
for the arrival and dispatch of mails between New
York and Albany and New England, and also between
New York and the South. Mail from New England
and Albany arrived on Wednesday and Saturday in
winter, and on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday in
summer. The income of the office at that time was
$2,789.84. Compare that sum and the income for the
twelve months ended September 30, 1911, when, for
the first time in the history of the New York office,
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the recipts for'">the receipts for</ins> any twelve consecutive months passed
the twenty million dollar mark, being exactly
$20,451,172.53.”</p>


<h3>Franklin First Postmaster General.</h3>

<p>It is an interesting and singular coincidence, overlooked
by some of our historians, that the man to
whom most credit is due, probably, for the organization
of our national postal service was Benjamin
Franklin, who did so much to encourage and promote
the use of electricity, the other great medium for
transmitting intelligence. Franklin was the first Postmaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
General under the Revolutionary organization,
before the adoption of the Constitution in 1787. He
was chosen because of his earlier experience in postal
matters, as postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737, and as
Deputy Postmaster General of the British Colonies
in 1753. He was removed from the latter office, to
punish him for his active sympathies with the
colonists. When Independence was declared one of the
first acts of his fellow patriots was to place him at the
head of the Post Office Department. But the stern
necessities of the Revolution called for Franklin’s
great abilities to perform services of still greater importance,
and Richard Bache, his son-in-law, was
chosen to succeed him as Postmaster General, in
November, 1776. Mr. Bache was succeeded by
Ebenezer Hazard, the compiler of the valuable historical
collection bearing that name. He held the office
until the adoption of the Constitution and the inauguration
of Washington.</p>

<p>Washington chose for his Postmaster General,
Samuel Osgood, of the famous New England family.
He had been graduated from Harvard College in 1770.
He soon became a member of the Massachusetts
Legislature, a member of the Board of War, and subsequently
an aid to General Ward. In 1779, he was
chosen a member of the Massachusetts Constitutional
Convention, and two years later was elected a member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of Congress. After four years in Congress he became
first Commissioner of the Treasury. When he left
Washington’s cabinet he was made Naval Officer of
the Port of New York where he died August 12, 1813.</p>

<h2 class="no-brk"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />
<br />
<span class="fs90 bold">WHAT IS REQUIRED OF CANDIDATES.</span></h2>


<p>Clerks and carriers must be citizens of the United
States, physically fit for the service and temperate.
They must be more than 18 years of age and not more
than 45, stand 5 feet 4 inches in height in bare feet
and weigh not less than 125 pounds without overcoat
and hat. Some applicants who know they are below
the weight foolishly try to secrete about their person,
beneath the soles of their feet, or in their hair weighty
materials to make up the deficiency. Not one in a
hundred ever succeeds in fooling the lynx-eyed examiners,
but those who try, do succeed in getting themselves
blackballed and are debarred from taking examinations
in the future. Female applicants are not
required to be of any specific height or weight. The
age limits are waived in the cases of persons honorably
discharged from the military or naval service by reason
of disability resulting from wounds received or sickness
incurred in the line of duty, but they are waived
only for such persons as have been physically disabled
in the way mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<h3>Physical Conditions.</h3>

<p>Eye glasses are permitted during the examination,
but very serious defective sight is sufficient to cause
rejection. As also are defective hearing, or speech;
persons blind in one eye; one-armed, one-handed, or
one-legged persons, or those having crippled arms or
legs, or those suffering from asthma or hernia. Deaf
mutes and persons with defective speech may, however,
be appointed to the positions of mail clerk, distributor,
and directing and forwarding clerk. Applicants
also are excluded from examinations for any of
the following reasons:</p>

<p>That he is, on the date of the examination, under the
minimum or over the maximum age limitation.</p>

<p>That he has any of the following defects: Insanity,
tuberculosis, paralysis, epilepsy, blindness, loss of both
arms or both legs, loss of arm and leg, badly crippled
or deformed hands, arms, feet, or legs, uncompensated
calvular disease of the heart, locomotor ataxia, cancer,
Bright’s disease, diabetes, or is otherwise physically
disqualified for the service which he seeks.</p>

<p>That he is addicted to the habitual use of intoxicating
beverages to excess.</p>

<p>That he is enlisted in the United States Army or
Navy and has not secured permission for his examination
from the Secretary of War or the Secretary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the Navy, respectively. Written permission must be
filed with the formal application.</p>

<p>That he has, within approximately one year, passed
the same examination for which he again desires to
apply. This restriction does not apply to persons who,
having taken one annual examination, desire to take
the next annual examination, although a full year may
not have elapsed.</p>

<p>That he has been dismissed from the Federal service
for delinquency or misconduct within one year preceding
the date of his application. Whether or not an
application will be accepted after the expiration of a
year from a person dismissed from the service rests
with the Commission, and each case of this character
will be considered on its individual merits.</p>

<p>That he has failed after probation to receive absolute
appointment to the position for which he again
applies within one year from the date of the expiration
of his probationary service.</p>

<p>That he has made a false statement in his application,
or has been guilty of fraud or deceit in any manner
connected with his application or examination, or
has been guilty of crime or infamous or notoriously
disgraceful conduct.</p>

<p>That he has been discharged for desertion from the
military or naval service of the United States under
section 1998, Revised Statutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>


<h3>Clerks and Carriers Are Bonded.</h3>

<p>Each clerk and carrier when appointed to the service
must furnish bonds in the sum of $1,000. In most
first and second class cities there are surety companies
that make a specialty of supplying such bonds for persons
on entering the postal service. The charge,
which is paid by the employee, is twenty-five cents
per annum for a carrier and fifty cents for a clerk. In
addition the carrier must furnish his own uniform and
cap, which averages from $15.00 to $20.00 a year. The
only other expense imposed upon a clerk is thirty-five
cents for his badge, and this is returned to him when
he leaves the service and surrenders the badge.</p>

<h2 class="no-brk"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />
<br />
<span class="fs90 bold">SALARIES AND OPPORTUNITIES.</span></h2>


<p>The salaries for postal clerk and carrier are the same
throughout the Union. Starting in at $600 the first
year, the man who is efficient and has a clean record
is advanced to $800 at the beginning of the second
year; the third year he goes to $900 and so on to the
sixth year when he reaches the maximum for this
branch of the service, $1,200. But there are opportunities
beyond this to clerks of exceptionable ability, and
to carriers, too, if they elect to be transferred to the
clerical branch, as is evidenced in the brilliant career
of Postmaster Morgan of New York, referred to in the
<a href="#CHAPTER_I">opening chapter</a>. Transfers are permitted from carrier
to clerk, or visa versa, after three or four years
service.</p>


<h3>Promotion For Good Clerks.</h3>

<p>In cities having sub-stations, clerks are eligible
to promotion to assistant superintendent, and then to
superintendent, with salaries ranging from $1,300 to
$2,500. They may also file applications with the postmaster
through their station superintendent for transfer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to another branch of the service, such as registry
division. No other examination is necessary, the
places there, as also on the windows, inquiry department,
and on money order windows being given to
clerks who show meritorious service. The only promotion
examination given is to the money order division,
which is not to be confused with positions at
money order windows. Besides involving grave responsibilities
the clerks in the money order division
are subject only to day work and have no night shifts.</p>


<h3>Hours of Labor.</h3>

<p>Employees in all branches of the federal government
are required to work only eight hours a day. The
hours, however, may not always be consecutive. Postal
clerks, for instance, work usually in three shifts.
The hours vary but the following may be taken as an
example, allowing one hour for meals:</p>

<p>First shift, 10 A. M., until 7 P. M., second shift, 4
P. M., until 1 A. M.; third shift, 12 midnight until 9
A. M. If clerks are required to work overtime they are
given compensatory time or leaves of absence during
the week corresponding to the number of hours overtime.
This also applies to Sunday work.</p>

<p>Carriers are not allowed to work overtime and when
they do “demerits” are registered against them. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
a carrier is at the call of the government, so to speak,
more hours in a day than is a clerk, his hours of actual
duty are the same, eight. They have “swings,” or
periods of intermission, between deliveries when their
time is their own and they are permitted to go where
they please. Regular carriers make deliveries only,
and are rarely, if ever, called upon to make collections.</p>

<p>Violations of the rules and inefficiency are punished
by a system of “demerits” ranging from 1 to 500 according
to the degree of the offense. “Demerits” in
any considerable number naturally affect a man’s advancement.
Anything less than 500 is usually wiped
out at the end of a year and the offender starts again
with a clean slate. But if 500 or more is charged up
against a man it remains a constant reminder of past
shortcomings.</p>

<p>Clerks and carriers who resign from the service may
be reinstated within one year, but, unless their absence
was due to illness, they lose a grade. In other words,
they must work a year for $100 less salary than they
received at time of resignation. In case of illness employees
must notify the postmaster through their
superintendent, without delay. Salaries are paid the
1st and 16th of each month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>


<h3>“Subs.”</h3>

<p>“Subs,” in the parlance of the postal service, are
men taken from the regular eligible lists to act as substitute
clerks and letter carriers. In every large office
there is always a lot of emergency work due to sickness,
or unusual demands. “Sub” clerks work on an
average from six to nine months&mdash;the duration varies
greatly in different offices&mdash;before receiving a permanent
appointment, while “sub” carriers have to work
from three to four years before they get a steady job.
The collection of mail from street letter boxes is entrusted
to “sub” carriers, regular carriers attending
only to the delivery of mail. All “subs” receive thirty
cents per hour and their salary averages from $50 to
$60 per month.</p>


<h3>Carriers’ Moral Responsibility.</h3>

<p>Carriers are not allowed to put letters into their own
pockets to carry them nor to throw away even the
slightest piece of mail, however valueless and unimportant
it may appear. He must return to the office
everything that is undelivered, and after every trip
must bring back his satchel and his key, and make
his comprehensive written return in detail of the number
and character of the pieces handled by him. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
piece of mail entrusted to him has its particular place
and all must be arranged with system and order. He
is forbidden under all circumstances to return to any
person whatever letters deposited by them in the street
mailing boxes from which he makes collections, but if
the sender of the letter wishes it back, he must report
to the postmaster through the head of his division, and
the postmaster has exclusive discretion to return it to
the writer.</p>

<br />
<span class="fs90 bold">WHERE AND HOW TO OBTAIN APPLICATION.</span></h2>


<p>Examinations for the postal service usually are held
in the fall, about the first Wednesday or Saturday in
November of each year. Prospective applicants
should write to the secretary of the civil service district
in which they reside&mdash;a list of these will be found
in the <a href="#CHAPTER_V">chapter</a> under that heading&mdash;for the exact date
and place of the mental test and the time when applications
may be had. The blank, a copy of which is
given elsewhere in this book, must be carefully and correctly
filled and all questions must be answered. This
requirement must not be overlooked, as to do so
would mean the sending of the application back to the
applicant for correction, thus causing loss of valuable
time.</p>

<p>All answers must be written in ink, the application
in the handwriting of the applicant and the vouchers
in the handwriting of the signers. There must be no
discrepancy in the name of the applicant in any part
of the application or in the vouchers. For New York:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Physical examinations take place after the mental examinations,
and only when called for appointment.</p>

<p>To make this point clear, applicants must see that
all names are signed alike in every part of the application.
For instance: John Doe must be John Doe everywhere
and not J. Doe in one place and John Doe elsewhere.</p>

<p>Applications or vouchers which are executed or
dated more than six months before the date of filing
will not be accepted. After the blank is properly executed,
it must be filed with the secretary of the local
board of examiners. So far as possible file applications
personally. If circumstances are such that the
application must be mailed, register it and obtain a
receipt for same. All applications must be sworn to
before a Notary Public.</p>

<p>Whenever extra examinations may become necessary,
to meet the needs of the service, due announcement
will be made of the dates and places of such examinations,
and also of the time allowed for the filing
of applications.</p>

<p>A person cannot at the same time be an applicant
for or eligible from examination for more than one
first-class post office for which examinations ordinarily
are held annually in November. This restriction will
not apply, however, when an examination is held for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
any of these offices on a date other than that of the
regular annual examination.</p>

<p>A person who passes an examination can not be
examined again for the same post office within approximately
one year of the date of the examination he has
passed. A person who fails in an examination may
take the next examination regardless of the time intervening.</p>

<p>A request for a change in the designation of the
position desired by an applicant must be made in writing
and be received by the district secretary on or before
the date set for the close of receipt of applications,
otherwise no change will be made.</p>

<p>The postmaster is required to make selection for a
vacancy from not more than the highest three names
on the appropriate register, and for the next and
any additional vacancies from not more than the
highest three remaining which have not been within
his reach for three separate vacancies. The name of
an eligible must have been within reach for three
separate vacancies in a position before it may be
passed over in making selection for appointment to
that position.</p>

<p>When an eligible’s name is borne on both the clerk
and the carrier registers and has been three times certified
(considered) for one of the two positions, but not
selected, his name will not be further certified for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
position, but his standing on the register for the other
position will not be affected. Neither will declination
of appointment when selected for one of the positions
affect the eligible’s standing on the register for the
other position. Appointment to either position will
remove the eligible’s name from the registers for both
positions.</p>

<p>An eligible who has been within reach for three
separate vacancies in either the position of clerk or of
carrier in his turn may subsequently be selected for
the position, subject to the approval of the Commission,
from the certificate upon which his name last appeared,
if the condition of the register has not so
changed as to place him in other respects beyond reach
of certification.</p>

<p>In the Post Office Service appointments are usually
made to the position of substitute clerk or substitute
carrier. Substitutes are promoted in the order of their
original appointment to the first vacancies occurring
in regular positions. Declination of appointment as
substitute will remove the name of the eligible from
the register from which selection was made, and it
will not be restored for consideration in connection
with appointment to a regular position only.</p>

<p>Auxiliary employees are paid for actual service at
the rate of 30 cents an hour. They are required to
work not less than two hours daily, and may serve as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
substitutes. They are eligible for appointment as
clerks and carriers of the first grade.</p>

<p>All promotions of both clerks and carriers will be
made at the beginning of the quarter following the
expiration of the year’s service in the next lower grade.
No promotion will be made except upon evidence satisfactory
to the Post Office Department of the efficiency
and faithfulness of the employee during the preceding
year. When a clerk or carrier fails of promotion because
of unsatisfactory service, he may be promoted
at the beginning of the second quarter thereafter, or
of any subsequent quarter, upon evidence that his
record has been satisfactory during the intervening
period. Clerks and carriers of the highest grade are
eligible for promotion to the higher positions in their
respective offices.</p>

<p>Any male clerk in an office in which both clerks
and city carriers are employed, is eligible for transfer
to the position of city carrier, and any city carrier is
eligible for transfer to the position of clerk. Male
clerks and city carriers are also eligible for transfer to
the position of rural carrier.</p>

<span class="fs90 bold">THE EDUCATIONAL TEST.</span></h2>

<h3>Subjects and Weights and Specimens of Previous<br />
Questions Asked.</h3>


<p>Examinations for the Postal Service are of the second
grade. Any person with a common school education
should have no trouble in passing them. The
average candidate, however, has been some years out
of school and is very apt to be what we call “rusty.”
In other words, to have forgotten much that he was
taught at school concerning the subjects required.
The wise thing for him to do, when he has made up
his mind to take the examination, no matter whether
the date of it is one month or six months away, the
longer the better, is to improve his knowledge of each
subject as much and as far as is possible. He must
not content himself with just getting on the list, many
of which are cancelled while yet there remain many
names not reached for appointment, but do his utmost
to win the highest possible rating.</p>

<p>The government service to-day, particularly the
postal branch, is no place for indifferent, sluggish, or
inefficient men. Though 70 per cent. is the passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
mark to obtain a place on the list, it is a poor recommendation
of a man’s intelligence and efficiency, or
of his possible growth in these attainments. And
really there is no excuse for a man who can read and
write getting so low a percentage. It shows, more or
less convincingly, that he was not diligent, that there
was little or no earnestness in his purpose, and the
average postmaster will not be over-eager to find a
place for him.</p>

<p>The questions in each subject are simple, and any
man of ordinary education can, unaided by outside
instructors, fit himself to obtain 90 per cent. with ease.
A few simple text books, and steady, pains-taking
study during leisure hours are all that are necessary.
A postal card to THE CHIEF will promptly bring to
you a list of books covering each subject, each book
prepared by an expert on civil service.</p>

<p>Applicants are notified of the date and place of an
examination at least two weeks in advance of the time
set.</p>

each problem should be given in full. The answer
to each problem should be indicated by writing “Ans.”
after it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Add the following, and from the sum subtract
32,885,696 (here will be given a short column of figures).</p>

<p>2. Multiply 7-2/25ths by 36.8, and divide the product
by 1.92. Solve by decimals.</p>

<p>3. A carrier can assort 43 letters or 37 papers in a
minute. At this rate, how many hours will it take
him to assort 3,655 letters and 185 pounds of papers,
averaging 7 papers to the pound?</p>

<p>4. A lot which was 53 feet wide and 150 feet long
sold for $8,347.50, which was one-fourth more than it
cost. What was the cost per square foot?</p>

<p>5. In a certain mail there are 294 pounds 14 ounces
of newspapers weighing at the rate of 3 papers to every
7 ounces. How many papers are there in the mail?

<h3>Problems In Earlier Examinations.</h3>

<p>If a railroad car runs 41-1/2 miles per hour, how far
would it go in 12 days running 10-1/2 hours per day?</p>

<p>If paper is worth 40 cents per pound, what is the
cost of one sheet of paper weighing six pounds to the
ream? (480 sheets equals one ream.)</p>

<p>An office uses 98 pounds of twine per year in tying
packages. Allowing 178 yards to the pound, how many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
packages are tied if each requires an average of 1-1/2
feet?</p>

<p>Multiply 696.6 by 785.09 and divide the product by
25.</p>

<p>A carrier makes 4 trips a day, carrying 64 letters and
32 papers each trip. The letters average in weight 1/4
oz. each, and the papers 2 oz. each. How many pounds
of mail does he deliver in a day? (16 oz. to the pound.)</p>

<p>Multiply 26.32 by 3, and to the product add 2.04.</p>

<p>Three gross of lead pencils are divided equally
among the clerks in a post office, giving to each clerk
eleven and leaving a remainder of fourteen pencils.
How many clerks are there in the office.</p>


<h3>Third Subject&mdash;Letter Writing.</h3>

<p>The competitor is given his choice of one of two
subjects on which to write a letter of not less than 125
words. One year the subjects were on the advantages
of city and of country life. At another time the candidates
were required to tell what they thought of our
colonial expansion in Porto Rico and the Philippines.
In a recent test one of the subjects was “Give your
views as to the advantages derived from free public
libraries in the principal cities of your State.” The
object of this exercise is to test the candidate’s skill
in writing an intelligent letter. Errors in form and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
address, in spelling, capitalization, punctuation, syntax
and style, count against the competitor. The rules for
rating will be found under a separate <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">chapter</a>.</p>


<h3>Fourth Subject&mdash;Penmanship.</h3>

<p>The rating on penmanship will be determined <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'by legability'">by
legibility</ins>, rapidity, neatness, and general appearance
and by correctness and uniformity in the formation of
words, letters, and punctuation marks in the exercise
of the subject of copying from plain copy. No particular
style of penmanship is preferred.</p>


<h3>Fifth Subject&mdash;Copying From Plain Copy.</h3>

<p>Candidates are required to make an exact copy of a
piece of composition. All omissions and mistakes,
change of paragraphs, spelling, capitals and punctuation,
count against the competitor. The following was
given in a previous examination:</p>

<p>No recommendation of an applicant, competitor, or
eligible involving any disclosure of his political or religious
opinions or affiliations shall be received, filed
or considered by the Commission, by any board of
examiners, or by any nominating or appointing officer.
In making removals or reductions or in imposing punishment
for delinquency or misconduct, penalties like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
in character shall be imposed for like offenses, and
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'action therupon'">action thereupon</ins> shall be taken irrespective of the
political or religious opinions or affiliations of the
offenders. A person holding a position on the date
said position is classified under the civil service act
shall be entitled to all the rights and benefits possessed
by persons of the same class or grade appointed upon
examination under the provisions of said act.</p>


<h3>Sixth Subject&mdash;Reading Addresses.</h3>

<p>This exercise consists of the reading of a number
of written addresses, which are photolithographed on
one sheet. A second sheet is furnished, which contains
the same addresses, these addresses being printed
and containing errors of omission, substitution or insertion.
The competitor is required to indicate the errors
in each printed address by underscoring with a pencil
thus, ____, any portion of a printed address which
is not a correct copy of the written address, and by
a caret, thus <sub>^</sub>, any omitted words, figures or initials.
Words abbreviated in the written address, but printed
in full in the printed address, are regarded as correct,
if the correct words are printed. Differences in
punctuating or capitalization are not regarded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
errors. The time allowed will be limited, and the rating
will be determined on accuracy only.</p>

<p class="p2 pfs70 pg-brk">The following are illustrations of the method which
should be pursued in indicating errors.</p>

<h3>Lessons in Decimals.</h3>


<p>The paper on arithmetic in second grade examinations
usually contains one, sometimes two, problems
in common or decimal fractions. These are no
more difficult to solve when one understands the rules
governing them, than any simple test in addition, division,
etc. In whole numbers, as 57, 563, 4278, the
various units increase on a scale of ten to the left (or
decrease on the same scale of ten to the right). Thus
in the last number we say 8 units, 7 tens, 2 hundreds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and 4 thousands or four thousand two hundred
seventy-eight.</p>

<p>Decimals also decrease on a scale of ten to the right
(or increase on the same scale of ten to the left). In
writing decimals, we first write the decimal point,
which is the same mark we use at the close of a sentence
and is called a period. Then the first figure to
the right is called “tenths” and is written thus .6,
meaning six tenths. The second figure stands for hundredths
as .06, six hundredths; .006 for six thousandths;
.0006 for six ten-thousandths; .00006 for six
hundred-thousandths; .000006 for six millionths, etc.
When a whole number, previously mentioned, and
decimals are written together as 47.328, it is called a
mixed number.</p>

<p>The only distinction between reading whole numbers
and decimals is made by adding this to the ending
of decimals, and the denomination of the right-hand
figure must be expressed to give the proper value to
decimal parts. For instance, .12, is twelve hundredths;
.007, is seven thousandths; .062, is sixty-two thousandths;
.201, is two hundred one thousandths; .5562,
is five thousand five hundred sixty-two ten-thousandths;
.24371, is twenty-four thousand three hundred
seventy-one hundred-thousandths; .893254, is eight
hundred ninety-three thousand two hundred fifty-four
millionths, etc. Remember that in decimals the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
first figure stands for, tenths; the second, hundredths;
the third, thousandths; the fourth, ten-thousandths;
the fifth, hundred-thousandths; the sixth, millionths,
and that in reading decimals we add the denomination
of the right-hand figure. When reading a mixed number
the word “<b>and</b>” is used, and then only, to indicate
the decimal point. Thus 45.304 should be read forty-five
AND three hundred four thousandths.</p>

<p>Addition and subtraction of decimals differ from
similar operations of whole numbers only in the placing
of the figures. In whole numbers units come
under units, tens under tens, etc. To illustrate:</p>

<p>What is the sum of 260, 4398, 305, 2, 29?</p>

<p>The figures are placed thus:</p>

    <!-- Using "tdr" does not work in .mobi, it aligns to the left.  -->
    <!-- So use "tdl" and adjust alignment with &nbsp;  -->

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td class="tdl">4,398</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">4,994</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Now let us take the same figures expressed decimally:
.260, .4398, .305, .2, .29.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">&nbsp; .260</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">&nbsp; .4398</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">&nbsp; .29</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">1.4948</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In subtraction of whole numbers or decimals the
figures are placed as in addition.</p>

<p>Examples&mdash;Subtract .204 from .4723.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">.4723</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">.204</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">.2683</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Subtract 5.346 from .937.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">5.346</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">&nbsp; .937</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">4.409</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Subtract .753 from 18. (Note that the point or
period is placed to the left of “753” indicating decimals,
but in connection with the number “18,” a dot
is placed to the right as a mark of punctuation merely,
thus showing that “18” is a whole number.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Now from the whole number “18,” which is the minuend
because it is the number to be subtracted from,
we are to subtract .753, and it is done in this way:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">Minuend</td><td class="tdl">18.000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Subtrahend</td><td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.753</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdl">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdl">17.247</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The three ciphers are added to the minuend to correspond
to the decimal places in the subtrahend. It is
not necessary to put the ciphers down, but beginners
are apt to get confused if there is nothing there to
correspond to the decimals below. Annex as many
ciphers to the minuend as there are decimals in the
subtrahend, and place in the remainder a decimal point
under those of the numbers subtracted.</p>

<p>Multiplication of decimals differs somewhat from
the previous operations mentioned for the reason that
we do not necessarily place the decimal points directly
under each other. The right-hand figure of the multiplier
usually goes under the right-hand figure of the
multiplicand and the problem is then worked out as
in multiplying whole numbers. When the product is
obtained we point off as many decimal places in it as
there are in both the multiplier and the multiplicand.</p>

<p>Let us take as an example: Multiply 2.648 by 2.35</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

    <!-- Using "tdr" does not work in .mobi, it aligns to the left.  -->
    <!-- So use "tdl" and adjust alignment with &nbsp;  -->

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">Multiplicand</td><td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.648</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Multiplier</td><td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.35</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdl">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13240</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7944</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdl">&nbsp;5296</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdl">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Product</td><td class="tdl">6.22280</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>It will be seen that there are three decimals in the
multiplicand and 2 decimals in the multiplier, hence
we point off five decimals in the product.</p>

<p>In the operation of division of decimals the decimal
point is not considered until the result is obtained. If
the number of decimal places in the dividend is less
than the number of decimal places in the divisor
ciphers must be annexed or added to make up the
deficiency, and the decimal point is then suppressed,
thus reducing the operation to the division of two
whole numbers. If there is no remainder, the quotient
is a whole number, if there is a remainder, add a
cipher to the right of it and place a decimal point to
the right of the quotient obtained, then continue the
division as far as desirable by adding ciphers to the
right of the successive remainders, for each of which a
new decimal will be obtained in the quotient.</p>

<p>Divide 460 by .5.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

</table></div>

<p>Fractions are reduced to decimals by annexing
ciphers to the numerator and then dividing by the denominator.</p>

<p>For instance&mdash;5/8 equals what decimal?</p>

problem should be given in full. The answers to each
problem should be indicated by writing “Ans.” after it.</p>

<p><b>Arithmetic</b> is the science of numbers.</p>

<p><b>A Number</b> is the result of the comparison (also called
measurement) of a magnitude or quantity with another
magnitude or quantity of the same kind supposed to
be known.</p>

<p><b>A Concrete Number</b> is one the nature of the unit of
which is known.</p>

<p><b>Denominate Number.</b>&mdash;A concrete number the standard
of which is fixed by law or established by long
usage.</p>

<p><b>An Abstract Number</b> is one of which the nature of
the unit is unknown.</p>

<p><b>How to Read Numbers.</b>&mdash;The right way to read
101,274, etc., is one hundred one, two hundred seventy-four,
etc.</p>

<p><b>The Decimal Point.</b>&mdash;A period, called decimal point,
is placed in a mixed number between the integral part
and the decimal portion which follows. It should never
be omitted.</p>

<p><b>Roman Numbers.</b>&mdash;I stands for 1, V for 5, X for 10,
L for 50, C for 100, D for 500 and M for 1,000.</p>

<p><b>Abbreviations.</b>&mdash;A smaller unit, written to the left
of a greater one, is subtracted from the latter, as: IV = 4<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
(IV is marked IIII on clock and watch dials); IX = 9;
XC = 90; CD = 400, etc. Sometimes a Roman number
is surmounted by a dash or vinculum; it then expresses
thousands, as <span class="over">IX</span> = 9,000.</p>


<h3>Addition.</h3>

<p><b>Addition.</b>&mdash;Operation which consists in taking in any
order all the units and portions of units of several numbers
and forming with them a single number called
their Sum or Total.</p>

<p><b>Addition of Long Columns of Numbers.</b>&mdash;When
long columns of numbers are to be added, the student
should endeavor to add more than one figure at a time.
He may pick those which aggregate 10, 15, 20, etc., and
add the intermediate figures when convenient.</p>

<p><b>Sign of Addition.</b>&mdash;The sign of addition is the horizontal-vertical
or Roman cross + placed between all
the numbers to be added; it is read Plus.</p>

<p><b>To Prove an Addition.</b>&mdash;The shortest way to prove
an addition is to do it over again from bottom to top.</p>

<p><b>Sign of Equality.</b>&mdash;The sign of equality is two short
equal horizontal parallels =; it reads Equal.</p>


<h3>Subtraction.</h3>

<p><b>Subtraction.</b>&mdash;An operation which consists in taking
from a number called <b>minuend</b> (m) all the units and
parts of units contained in another number called <b>subtrahend</b> (s).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
The result is called the <b>difference</b> (d)
of the two numbers or the <b>remainder</b> of their subtraction.</p>

<p><b>Sign of Subtraction.</b>&mdash;The sign of subtraction is a
horizontal dash - placed between the minuend, written
first, and the subtrahend. Thus: <span class="nowrap">84 - 38 = d;</span>
<span class="nowrap">84 - 38 = 46.</span> Generally <span class="nowrap">m - s = d.</span></p>

<p><b>To Prove a Subtraction.</b>&mdash;Add from bottom to top
the difference and the subtrahend; the sum must equal
the minuend.</p>


<h3>Multiplication.</h3>

<p><b>Multiplication.</b>&mdash;An operation which consists in repeating
a number called <b>multiplicand</b> (M) as many
times as there are units in another column called <b>multiplier</b>
(m); the result is called the <b>product</b> (p) of the
numbers, and the numbers themselves are called <b>factors</b>
of the product. This definition may be extended to the
case where the factors are not whole numbers.</p>

<p><b>Sign of Multiplication.</b>&mdash;The sign of multiplication
is the oblique or St. Andrew’s cross ×, called multiplied
by, and placed between the factors written one
after the other.</p>

<p>Thus: <span class="nowrap">35 × 7 = p; 35 × 7 = 245.</span>
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Generally MXm = p.'">Generally <span class="nowrap">M × m = p.</span></ins></p>

<p><b>To Prove a Multiplication.</b>&mdash;Multiplication may be
proved by a second multiplication in which the factors
are inverted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the surest but the longest method.</p>

<p><b>Another Proof of the Multiplication.</b>&mdash;Find the
residue of the multiplicand and multiplier. Multiply
them and find the residue of their product; this is equal
to the residue of the product of the multiplication.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl pad3">64327</td><td class="tdl">&nbsp; 4</td><td class="tdl">Residue of the multiplicand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl pad4">781</td><td class="tdl">&nbsp; 7</td><td class="tdl">Residue of the multiplier.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">50239387</td><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdl">1 &nbsp; Residue of the product of multiplication.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><b>Proof Not Absolute.</b>&mdash;Practically a proof is not absolute,
because an error may be committed in its use, and
also it may not work well in all cases.</p>

<p><b>Power of a Number.</b>&mdash;When the factors of a product
are equal, the product is called a power of the factor.</p>

<p><b>Square of a Number.</b>&mdash;A power is a square when it is
the product of two (2) equal factors, as <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: '7 + 7 = 49'"><span class="nowrap">7 × 7 = 49</span></ins>, in
which 49 is the square of 7. The term square is derived
from the fact that the area of a square is obtained by
multiplying the length of its side by itself, or taking it
twice as a factor.</p>

<p><b>Cube of a Number.</b>&mdash;A power is a cube when it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the product of three (3) equal factors, as <span class="nowrap">5 × 5 × 5 = 125</span>,
in which 125 is the cube of 5.</p>

<p>The term cube is derived from the fact that the
volume of a cube is obtained by multiplying the length
of its side by itself and again by itself, or by taking it
three times as a factor.</p>

<p>A product, for instance, of 4, 9, etc., equal factors
would be called the 4th or the 9th, etc., power of that
number.</p>


<h3>Division.</h3>

<p><b>Division.</b>&mdash;An operation by means of which we find
one of two factors of a product when that product and
the other factor are given. The given product is called
<b>Dividend</b> (D) of the division; the known factor is
called the <b>Divisor</b> (d), and the unknown factor which
is sought is called <b>Quotient</b> (q). We know that a
quotient is seldom exact and that there is generally a
<b>Remainder</b> (r) or <b>Residue</b>.</p>

<p><b>Sign of Division.</b>&mdash;The sign of division is a small
dash with a point above and one below ÷; it is read
divided by, is placed after the dividend, and is followed
by the divisor. For instance, to indicate the division

write <span class="nowrap">72 ÷ 8 = 9;</span> generally <span class="nowrap">D ÷ d = q.</span></p>

<p><b>Other Sign of Division.</b>&mdash;In the study of fractions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
it is shown that a fraction expresses the quotient of its
numerator by its denominator, so that the preceding
identity may be written
 <span class="blkb nowrap">
   <span class="blka">72</span>
   <span class="blka over">8</span>
 </span> = 9, or more generally

 <span class="blkb nowrap">
   <span class="blka">D</span>
   <span class="blka over">d</span>
 </span> = q, and another sign of division is a horizontal line separating
the dividend written above it from the divisor written below it.</p>

<p><b>Proof of the Division.</b>&mdash;We prove a division by multiplying
the divisor by the quotient and adding the remainder,
if there is any; the result thus obtained must
equal the dividend. When there is a remainder, the
formula of division is <span class="nowrap">D = dq + r.</span></p>

<p>There are certain “standard errors,” so to speak, that
the unsuccessful candidate makes nine times out of
ten, and if these are eliminated every one, with a little
practice, may put himself in line for 100 per cent.</p>

<p>While the examples may take the form of “problems,”
the only processes involved will be simple addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division&mdash;no fractions
or decimals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition there is but one thing to be observed. If
your numbers are not all of equal length arrange them
so that the last figures are all in the same column.
Suppose you have to add 357,856, 7,596, 452 and 29,360.
Following are the right and wrong ways to arrange
them:</p>

    <!-- Using "tdr" does not work in .mobi, it aligns to the left.  -->
    <!-- So use "tdl" and adjust alignment with &nbsp;  -->

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">Right way.</td><td class="tdl pad12">&nbsp;</td><td class="tdlx">Wrong way.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">&nbsp;357,856</td><td></td><td class="tdl">357856</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7,596</td><td></td><td class="tdl">7596</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;452</td><td></td><td class="tdl">452</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29,360</td><td></td><td class="tdl">29360</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td><td></td><td class="tdl">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This arrangement is necessary because of the inherent
properties of numbers as expressed in figures, under
what we call our decimal system, which means simply
the practice we have adopted of expressing our numbers
in multiples of ten. This arose from the fact that
we happen to be born with ten fingers, and our
ancestors, like our children, learned to count by means
of those very useful “markers.”</p>

<p>In the system of counting every place, or column,
counting from the right, has a value ten times greater
than the one in the place or column nearest on the
right. Thus in the number 36,542 the first figure on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the right represents “ones,” the next ten times as much
or “tens,” the next ten times as much again or “hundreds,”
and so on. We really read this number backward
when we name it, for in handling it in any way
we have to start with the last figure, representing the
“ones.” The number really means two ones, four tens,
five hundreds, six thousands and three ten thousands.
It is built up this way, really by addition:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdr">2</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">40</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">500</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">6000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">30000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">36,542</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Now, this principle underlies the processes called
“carrying” and “borrowing.” You wish to add 26 and
37. Adding the 6 ones to the 7 you get 13 ones, or
3 ones and 1 ten. So you “carry” that 1 ten to the
column where it belongs, leaving the 3 ones in <b>their</b>
proper column. Thus, in your tens column you have
2 tens plus 3 tens plus the 1 ten “carried,” which makes
6 tens; and your result is 63, or 6 tens and 3 ones.</p>

<p>Again, you want to subtract 19 from 38. As you
cannot take 9 from 8, you “borrow” one of the 3 tens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
making your 8 into 18 and subtract 9 from that, leaving
9. By so doing you have left but 2 tens in your
tens column, and so there your subtraction is now from
2, leaving 1. Hence your result is 9 ones and 1 ten,
or 19.</p>

<p>Here is an example in subtraction which was once
used, and which is as likely to trip one up as any that
could be set. Subtract 199,999 from 320,012. The
result is as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">320,012</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">199,999</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">120,013</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Now, you cannot take 9 from 2, so you “borrow”
one from the left and make your two 12. Then 9
from 12 leaves 3. In borrowing from the left you
reduce the 1 in the tens column to 0. As you cannot
take 9 from 0, you must again borrow from the left.
But what are you to borrow from? In the third, or
hundreds column there is only a 0. Hence, before you
can borrow from this column you must make this 0
a 10 by borrowing from the fourth, or thousands column
(counting your columns always from the right).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>But again here you find only a 0, and so before you
can make even this “borrow” you must borrow one
from the 2 in the ten thousands column. Now see
what happens. With the one which you have finally
borrowed you have made the 0 left in the second or
tens column into a 10, and you take 9 from 10, which
leaves 1.</p>

<p>Now, here is where you forget something. When
you started out to “borrow” you had to go away over
to the 2 in the fifth column; that made your 0 in the
fourth column a 10, but you immediately passed this
one on to the third column, which left only 9; again
you passed it on from the third to the second column,
which left only a 9 in the third column. Hence you
have now a 9 in the third and in the fourth columns,
and your results there will be in each case 9 from 9
leaves 0.</p>

<p>Coming to the fifth you have a 1 instead of a 2,
having borrowed 1; and you have to borrow again
from the 3 to make your 1 into an 11, obtaining 9
from 11 leaves 2; and your sixth and last figure, being
reduced from 3 to 2, your last result is 1 from 2
leaves 1.</p>

<p>This last part is easy, but one out of practice is
almost certain to forget that his 0’s in the third and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
fourth columns became 9’s. If you have any difficulty
with subtraction, study out the processes in this
example until you understand them and you will never
make a mistake again.</p>

<p>Now, as to the shape in which the examples will be
given: The plain problems in addition will be unmistakable.
You will be told that a concern sold 27,356
barrels of flour in one month, 38,452 the next, etc.,
and you cannot well run off the track. But you may
find both processes involved in one “problem,” and you
must then be careful to understand just what is meant
by the question, so that you will know what you are
expected to do with the figures.</p>

<p>Take this, for example: “A had $3,465 and B $4,895.
A gained $1,146 and B lost $602. Which then had
the more, and how much?”</p>

<p>Here you must add A’s gain to his principal&mdash;that is,
the sum he had to start with&mdash;and subtract B’s loss
from his principal; then subtract the smaller result
from the larger, stating which is the “winner.” Thus:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">

</table></div>

<p>Answer.&mdash;A has $318 more.</p>

<p>When it comes to multiplication and division, there
is just one “catch,” so it might appear to the untrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
mind of some poor candidate, which is made
to play a part in nearly every problem. It is safe to
say that 90 per cent. of the failures on these two
processes turn on this one point. It is a very simple
one and really the same in both processes. It arises
in the handling of the “naught” or “cipher,” as we
used to call it, the “zero”&mdash;call it what you like, it is
nothing, anyhow. And that’s the point to be remembered.</p>

<p>Here is an example: Multiply 3,125 by 208. Now
it seems almost incredible, but I have seen literally
hundreds of papers, it seems to me, where this very
simple problem was worked out this way:</p>

<p class="center">The Wrong Way.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdr">3,125</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">208</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">25000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">3125 &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">6250 &nbsp; &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">681250</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Or else this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">Another Wrong Way.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdr">3125</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">208</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">25000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">6250 &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">87500</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The trouble is that when the poor fellow came to
multiply by the “naught” he forgot in the first instance
that it was nothing, and that the biggest number in
the world multiplied by nothing will produce nothing.
He knew that something ought to go down there, and
so in sheer desperation he wrote down the number he
was multiplying.</p>

<p>In the second instance, while he recognized that
nothing is nothing, he forgot that all our figuring is
done by columns, as we saw in our last lesson; so that
when we are multiplying by tens we must put our
first figure down in the hundreds column, and so on.
By forgetting this he multiplied his number by two
hundreds, but put his first figure down in the tens
columns, and thus he really multiplied by only 28
instead of 208.</p>

<p>Now, the very simplest way to avoid this sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
mistake is to “go through the motions” of multiplying
by the “naught” or “zero.” Thus:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="50%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">The Right Way.</td><td class="tdr">3,125</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="tdr">208</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="tdr">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="tdr">25000</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="tdr">0000 &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="tdr">6250 &nbsp; &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="tdr">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="tdr">650,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This looks a little clumsy, perhaps, but it is the
logical way&mdash;to go through the process of saying
naught times 5 is naught, naught times 2 is naught,
etc., putting down the results in the proper columns.
It is the safest way, if you are the least bit weak on
the principles of numbers, to do even the process of
multiplying by whole hundreds. Thus:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdr">3,125</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">200</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">0000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">0000 &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">6250 &nbsp; &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">625,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>By writing his example in the “short cut” style I
have seen many a man make this mistake:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="50%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">Wrong.</td><td class="tdr">3,125 &nbsp; &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdr">200</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdr">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdr">62500 &nbsp; &nbsp;</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>That is, after setting down his two surplus ciphers,
when he obtained another in multiplying 5 by 2, he
forgot that it was a new one and went right on to the
next process. If you are in that position that you
must really learn your arithmetic all over again, stick
to the logical method of showing every process and
learn the “short cuts” afterward.</p>

<p>Now, when the reverse situation arises in division,
a similar error is of frequent occurrence. Suppose
we are to divide 650,000 by 3,125. This sometimes
results:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="60%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">The Wrong Way.</td><td class="tdr">3,125)&nbsp;650,000&nbsp;(28</td></tr>
<tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="tdr padr3">625 0 &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="tdr padr3">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="tdr padr2">25,000 &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="tdr padr2">25,000 &nbsp;</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>That is, the figurer, when he came to try to divide
2,500 by 3,125, realizing that it would not “go,” simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
“brought down” another figure. He forgot that the
real mental process was 3,125 goes into 2,500 no
times, or produces “naught,” and that “naught,” or
“cipher,” must be set down in the proper <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'tens collumn'">tens column</ins>.
The only safe way, again, is to indicate every
process; to “bring down” but one figure at a time
and to set down every result, even the “nothings,” in
its proper place. That will make our example look
like this:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="60%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">The Right Way.</td><td class="tdr">3,125)&nbsp;650,000&nbsp;(208</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>Very simple, but let me “whisper,” if you really
master and understand the mysteries of “long division,”
you have crossed the Rubicon of education.
There is no door in all human learning that need remain
forever sealed to a persistent mind that has truly
found its way clearly and understandingly through this
first great stumbling block. Ask any old-fashioned
school teacher to dispute that proposition. And,
“whisper” again, there are men counting coupons who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
can do long division, to be sure, but who could not
tell you why it is done as it is, if the price of stocks
depended on it.</p>


<h3>Punctuation.</h3>

<p>Punctuation is a system of marks the purpose of
which is to indicate to the eye the relation of words to
one another in meaning, and so the relative importance
of the component parts of a written composition.</p>

<p>The marks of Punctuation, corresponding, for the
most part, to pauses in spoken language, are the comma
(,), the period (.), the note of interrogation (?),
the note of exclamation (!), the colon (:), the semi-colon
(;), the dash (&mdash;), parentheses ( ), brackets [ ],
quotation marks (“ ”), and the hyphen (-).</p>

<p><b>Purpose of Punctuation.</b>&mdash;To make a written composition
clear and intelligent, and to facilitate the task
of reading.</p>

<p><b>Avoid All Unnecessary Remarks.</b>&mdash;In modern writings
punctuation marks are less frequently used than
they were among writers in the early part of the last
century. A sentence consisting of a simple subject, a
simple predicate, and a simple object, or the relation
of whose parts is clearly intelligible without marks,
should not be encumbered with any. Take, for instance,
the following two sentences:</p>

<p>“The attack was prepared with impenetrable secrecy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“On the very morning of the massacre they were
in the houses and at the tables of those whose deaths
they were plotting.”</p>

<p><b>Comma.</b>&mdash;Three or more words of the same part of
speech not connected by conjunctions should be separated
from one another by commas.</p>

<p>“He was strong, alert, active.”</p>

<p>“New York City is grand, immense, beautiful.”</p>

<p>Two words contrasted with one another are separated
by a comma.</p>

<p>“He is slow, but sure.”</p>

<p>Words in a series of pairs should be separated by a
comma. “Young and old, strong and weak, fair and
dark, good and bad.”</p>

<p>Explanatory and parenthetical words or phrases
(such as “therefore,” “moreover,” “indeed,” “however,”
“in fact,” “to some extent,” etc.), inserted into the
body of a sentence are usually marked off by commas.</p>

<p>A comma is inserted after the name of a person or
thing addressed.</p>

<p>“John, you were mistaken.”</p>

<p>“My country, I am proud of thee.”</p>

<p><b>Period.</b>&mdash;The period (.) is put at the end of every
complete sentence that is not exclamatory or interrogative.
It is also used as a part of every abbreviation,
and after every initial letter standing in place of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
full word in a name. “A. M.” (for Master of Arts),
“Mr.” (for Mister), “Esq.” (for Esquire), “R. W.
Emerson” (for Ralph Waldo Emerson), “Dr.” (for
doctor).</p>

<p><b>Note of Interrogation.</b>&mdash;The note of interrogation
(?) should follow every direct question: “Are you
coming?” “Shall I buy it?” An interrogation point
does not, however, follow an indirect question, such
as “Let me know what he says.”</p>

<p><b>Note of Exclamation.</b>&mdash;The note of exclamation (!)
follows an exclamation, or any series of words denoting
an outburst of feeling. “Alas!” “Three cheers!”
“Hurrah!”</p>

<p><b>Colon.</b>&mdash;The colon (:) is used to divide from one
another the several co-ordinate members of a compound
sentence, when they might each of them form
an independent sentence, but are ranged side by side
in a compound sentence for the sake of better showing
how they illustrate one another.</p>

<p>“New York is a wonderful city: The wealthiest in
America.”</p>

<p>A quotation or enumeration of details is often preceded
by a colon.</p>

<p>“He spoke as follows:” “His last words were:”
“Among those present were:”</p>

<p><b>Semi-Colon.</b>&mdash;The semi-colon (;) separates co-ordinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
sentences more dependent on one another than
are those parted by the colon.</p>

<p>“Where it is prescribed that an act is to be done;
or that the adverse party has a specified time to do an
act; if service required is doubly the time allowed;
except that,” etc.</p>

<p>In sentences containing two sets of subjects and
predicates where either clause is very long or contains
a subordinate clause, it is well to use a semi-colon.</p>

<p><b>Parentheses.</b>&mdash;Parentheses (&thinsp;) are used to enclose
words or phrases in a sentence, inserted by way of explanation
or comment, but lying outside of the construction
of the sentence:</p>

<p>“You see (as I predicted would be the case) I have
had a long journey for nothing.”</p>

<p><b>Dash.</b>&mdash;The dash (&mdash;) denotes, in most cases, a sudden
digression from the general run of the sentence:
“I want to tell you&mdash;but first let us go into the house.”</p>

<p>Sometimes the dash takes the place of the parentheses,
when the clause, though digressive, bears
some relation to the context.</p>

<p><b>Brackets.</b>&mdash;Brackets [&thinsp;] are used to isolate interpolated
words from the passage in which they are used:</p>

<p>“The examiner said that if they [the candidates]
were discovered talking with each other he [the examiner]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
would have them [the candidates] expelled
from the room.”</p>

<p><b>Hyphen.</b>&mdash;A hyphen (-) is used, first to connect the
part of a word at the end of a line with the remaining
letters or syllables of the word beginning the next
line; second, to conjoin two or more words into a compound
word; as, “a never-to-be-forgotten day;” “long-winded,”
etc.</p>

<p>The part of a word to which the hyphen is attached
should be an integral part; that is, an entire syllable,
and not merely certain letters composing only a part
of a syllable.</p>

<p><b>Quotation Marks.</b>&mdash;Quotation marks (“&thinsp;”) are used
to distinguish a word, phrase, clause, sentence, or passage
taken word for word, from any source outside
that of the writing into which it is inserted.</p>

<p>A quotation within a quotation is marked off only
by a single inverted comma before and after it. But
a quotation within the second quotation requires double
marks.</p>

<p>A passage quoted, not word for word, but only in
substance, is often distinguished by but one quotation
mark before and after it.</p>

<p><b>Capital Letters.</b>&mdash;In examinations containing papers
the rating of which is determined in part by correctness
in the use of capital letters the average candidate
is usually at a disadvantage. The following rules, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
committed to memory, will enable the candidate to
avoid errors which, if made, might cause him to fail
in the examination.</p>

<p>The first word of every sentence should begin with
a capital letter.</p>

<p>The days of the week, the months of the year, and
holidays.</p>

<p>The names of places and countries; as, England,
Yonkers, Belmont Park, etc.</p>

<p>The names of States, Mountains, Rivers and Lakes.</p>

<p>All words used to signify the Deity; as, He, Him,
His, Thou, Thee, Thine, etc.</p>

<p>The names of persons, the titles of persons, and the
titles of books; as, John Brown, Lord Salisbury, Senator
Mitchell, “The Marble Faun.”</p>

<p>The first word in every line of poetry.</p>

<p>The pronoun I, and the exclamation O, or Oh.</p>

<p>The first word of a direct quotation should also begin
with a capital; as, “To thine own self be true.”</p>

<span class="fs90 bold">HOW COMPETITORS ARE JUDGED.</span></h2>

<h3>Methods by Which the Examiners Keep<br />
Candidates’ Identity Secret.</h3>


<p>After the examination, which is conducted with the
most scrupulous care to guard against favoritism or
fraud, the local examiners arrange the papers by
sheets or subjects and all are forwarded under seal to
the United States Commission. When they are
reached in the order of rating, they are distributed
by sheets to the examiners, Examiner A being given
all of sheets 1, Examiner B all of sheets 2, Examiner
C all of sheets 3, and so on, the sheets being distributed
to as many examiners as there are subjects in the particular
examination to be rated. After the papers are
rated in the first instance they are redistributed, and
the first rating is reviewed by other examiners.</p>

<p>When all of the papers of an examination have been
rated and reviewed, those of each competitor are then,
for the first time, assembled or brought together, his
average percentage is ascertained, his declaration
envelope is opened, and the declaration sheet to which
he has signed his name is attached to his examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
papers. The identity of the competitor, therefore, is
not disclosed until his papers have been rated and
reviewed and his average percentage determined. As
the charges for specific errors are all fixed by the rules
for rating, and as each subject is rated by two examiners
acting separately and then reviewed by both
jointly, it will be seen that absolute impartiality, accuracy
and uniformity are secured in the work.</p>

<p>Appeals from the ratings are sometimes made by
competitors, but the prospect of securing a higher rating
is very remote. Errors on the part of examiners
in making charges are seldom found, as the work of
each examiner is verified and checked in every particular
by another.</p>

<span class="fs90 bold">THE ELIGIBLE REGISTER.</span></h2>

<h3>How Names Are Placed on Eligible List and Mode of<br />
Certification to Postmasters.</h3>


<p>Usually it takes from three to six months to rate
all papers after an examination. Candidates that make
70 per cent. or over are then notified of their relative
standing. The period of eligibility for original
appointments is one year from the date of entering
the name on the register.</p>

<p>When a name has been placed upon a register it is
not disturbed until a postmaster calls for a list of
eligibles. Then the proper number of names are certified
to him and he chooses those he needs. The
names of all others are returned to the eligible register
to await further certifications.</p>

<p>In making appointments the postmaster has the
privilege of selecting one out of three down the list:
If he had but one vacancy he could select the third
name, but could not take the fourth; he also is permitted
to appoint in regular order straight down the
list, if he so choose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The probationary period for letter carriers and clerks
begins upon their promotion to the regular force and
not at the date of original appointment as substitutes.
The period of probation is limited to six months and
cannot be extended. At its close a probationer must
either be absolutely appointed or dismissed.</p>

<p>In determining the mark for <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'letter writting'">letter writing</ins> it is
proper for the examiner to be guided in a general way

<h3>RULES GOVERNING EXAMINATIONS.</h3>

<p class="center bold">Competitors Required to State Clearly Whether They<br />
Desire Eligibility for Clerk or Carrier.</p>


<p>There are in the United States, thirteen United
States Civil Service Districts, and in each, examinations
for letter carrier and clerk are held yearly. THE
CHIEF has obtained from the United States Civil
Service Commission the regulations governing the examinations
in each district, the post offices for which
examinations may be taken, the rules relative to the
registers for clerk or carrier in each district, the approximate
dates when examinations are held and
whether or not more than one examination may be
taken in the same Civil Service district. Intending
competitors should read carefully the section covering
their particular district, so as to know whether their
names can be placed on the carrier and clerk register,
or only on one. There is some difference in the regulations
covering this part of the requirements, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the rules for the examination proper, as given in the
preceding pages, are uniform all over the country.</p>


<h3>FIRST DISTRICT.</h3>

<p class="p1 center bold">Headquarters, Boston, Mass.</p>

<p>At the following named offices the names of male
eligibles will be entered on only one register, namely,

without regard to any choice of position expressed by
the eligible in his application. Male eligibles will be
entitled to three certifications from the male clerk register
and three certifications from the carrier register.
Failure of selection from one register or declination
of appointment when selected will not affect the eligible’s
standing on the other register. Appointment
from either register will remove the eligible’s name
from both registers.</p>

<h3>Regulations Differ from Those in the United States<br />&mdash;Mounted
Men in the Island Force.</h3>


<p>The Civil Service regulations for the Postal Service
in the Philippine Islands vary considerably from those
for the United States. There is only one examination&mdash;that
of letter carrier. Carriers are divided into two
classes, mounted and unmounted. The entrance salary
of an unmounted carrier is $360. The higher
classes are filled by promotion. All the carriers must
furnish their own uniforms, as in the United States,
while the mounted carriers must provide their own
conveyances. Both conveyances and uniforms are
subject to inspection and must be approved by the
Director of Posts.</p>

<p>The examination consists of tests in spelling, arithmetic,
penmanship, copying from plain copy, location
of buildings, streets, plazas, etc., in the City of Manila,
reading addresses and simple tests in English.</p>

<p>The following is an example of the questions asked
by the Philippine examiners in an examination for letter
carrier:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Spelling.&mdash;Question, Column, Regular, Possible,
Precious, Guardian, Entrance, Separate, Official,
Eager, Patience, Position, Exceed, Language, Explain,
Business, Receive, Copyist, Certify, Specimen.</p>

<p>Arithmetic.&mdash;1. Add the following numbers: 7,820,
140, 616,487, 18,021,762, 5,329,456, 5,647,893, 432,890,
23,578,932, and 45,004. From the sum of these numbers
extract 8,641,762.</p>

<p>2. Multiply 794.4 by 450-3/5, and divide the product
by 49.65.</p>

<p>3. A clerk received a salary of $720 a year. He
spent 3/5 of it for board, 1/4 of the remainder for clothing,
and $144 for all other expenses. How much did
he save?</p>

<p>4. An open court contains 160 sq. yds. How many
stones 9 inches square will be required to pave it?
(1,296 sq. in. equals 1 sq. yd.)</p>

<p>5. A Manila grocer imported 1,083 pounds of butter
at 39 cents a pound and sold it at 5/13 more than
it cost. If his expenses were $36.47, what was his net
profit?</p>

<p>Letter Writing.&mdash;Two subjects for letter writing
are given, and the competitor may select either upon
which to write a letter of not less than 125 words.
The exercise in letter writing is designed chiefly to
test the competitor’s skill in composition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Penmanship.&mdash;The rating on penmanship is determined
by legibility, neatness, rapidity and general appearance,
and by correctness and uniformity in the
formation of words, letters and punctuation marks in
the exercise in copying from plain copy. No particular
style of penmanship is preferred.</p>

<p>Copying from Plain Copy.&mdash;Candidates were required
to make an exact copy of the following:</p>

<p>“The hemp tree in the Philippines reaches an average
height of 10 feet. It is a native plant, the stem
of which is inclosed in layers of half-round petioles.
The hemp fiber is extracted from these petioles, which,
when cut down, are separated into strips 5 to 6 inches
wide, and drawn under a knife attached at one
end by a hinge to a block of wood, while the other
end is suspended from the extremity of a flexible stick.
The bow tends to raise the knife and a cord attached
to the same end of the knife, and a treadle is so arranged
that, by a movement of the foot, the operator
can bring the knife to work on the hemp petiole with
the pressure he chooses.”</p>

<span class="fs90 bold">RULES FOR LETTER CARRIERS.</span></h2>

<h3>How Mail Must Be Delivered&mdash;Work of Substitutes&mdash;<br />Requirements,
Uniforms, Etc.</h3>


<p>Letter carriers and substitute letter carriers are appointed
by the Postmaster General on the nomination
of the postmaster.</p>

<p>Selection of persons for appointment as substitute
letter carriers must be made by the postmaster from
the carriers’ eligible register in the manner prescribed
by the Civil Service Rules and the nominations submitted
to the First Assistant Postmaster General
(Division of Free Delivery), on Form 1101, together
with the certificate for original appointment, Postal
Service, Form 145, issued by the local Civil Service
Board. When two or more persons are nominated on
the same day for appointment as substitute letter carrier,
their seniority shall be determined by their standing,
or rating, on the eligible register, and not by the
order of their selection.</p>

<p>A vacancy in the regular force must be filled by the
promotion of the senior substitute, whom the postmaster
shall nominate for appointment on Form 1101.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
When a vacancy occurs in the regular force and there
are no substitute letter carriers the nomination for
appointment to fill such vacancy shall be made in the
manner prescribed in the appointment of substitute
letter carriers. The selection of letter carriers and
substitute letter carriers at new free delivery offices,
upon their establishment, is made from the carriers’
eligible register by the Postmaster General.</p>

<p>When a vacancy occurs or an emergency arises
necessitating the immediate appointment of a letter
carrier and there are no available substitutes, and the
eligible register contains less than three names, the
postmaster may nominate, for temporary appointment
not to exceed ninety days, any person of good character
who is within the age limitations. A postmaster
is not required to, but may make a selection from
an eligible register containing less than three names.</p>

<p>Reinstatements to the service will only be made in
accordance with Rule IX. of the Civil Service Rules.
Applications for reinstatement to the service must be
made through the postmaster to the First Assistant
Postmaster General (Division of Free Delivery). If
the application be favorably considered, the First Assistant
Postmaster General will make requisition on
the Civil Service Commission for a certificate for reinstatement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Where an applicant for reinstatement is an honorably
discharged soldier or sailor of the late Civil War
or war with Spain he must give the number of the
company and the regiment in which he served, and, if
possible, transmit through the postmaster the certificate
of his honorable discharge from the military or
naval service.</p>

<p>Transfers from the grade of clerk to that of carrier
in the same office may be made, provided they are
effected by exchange of positions, and the clerks to be
transferred are physically able to perform the duties
of a carrier, but transfers from the clerical force to
vacancies in the letter carrier force will not be permitted,
except in cases where, in the judgment of the
First Assistant Postmaster General, the best interests
of the service will be subserved.</p>

<p>The transfer of a carrier from one office to another
will not be permitted unless it is shown by the sworn
statement of a reputable physician that the health of
the carrier or of a member of his immediate family
requires a change of climate, and that the transfer is
desired on that account. Applications for transfer
must be indorsed by the postmaster and transmitted
by him to the First Assistant Postmaster General
(Division of Free Delivery), with a full statement of
the circumstances surrounding each case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Resignations of letter carriers and substitute letter
carriers must be made in writing and forwarded to
the First Assistant Postmaster General (Division of
Free Delivery). No resignation requested by the
postmaster, or by anyone for him, will be accepted.</p>

<p>Letter carriers will not be removed except for just
cause, upon written charges filed with the First Assistant
Postmaster General (Division of Free Delivery),
of which they shall be given due notice and allowed
full opportunity for defense. The charges shall specifically
set forth alleged delinquency or misconduct,
giving the date and place of the occurrence.</p>

<p>Every letter carrier shall give bonds, with sureties,
to be approved by the Postmaster General, for the
safe custody and delivery of all mail matter, and the
faithful account and payment of all money received by
him. Each letter carrier and substitute letter carrier
shall, at the time of his appointment, give bond in the
sum of one thousand dollars. It is preferred that
bonds furnished by one of the surety companies authorized
to act as sureties on official bonds be given.
The original bonds of two or more carriers or substitutes,
appointed at the same time, may be given on a
blanket or schedule form. Letter carriers transferred
from one post office to another, and substitutes promoted
to be regular carriers, must file new bonds, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
former bonds terminating on the date of such transfer
or promotion. A list of the companies authorized to
act as sole surety on official bonds will be furnished
upon application to the First Assistant Postmaster
General (Division of Free Delivery). All bonds of
carriers must be filed with the First Assistant Postmaster
General (Division of Free Delivery).</p>

<p>Every carrier, before beginning active service, shall
take the official oath prescribed in Section 207, which
oath will be retained on the files of the local post office,
subject to the call of the First Assistant Postmaster
General or to inspection by a post office inspector
or other officer of the Post Office Department.</p>


<h3>Uniforms of Carriers.</h3>

<p>The Postmaster General may prescribe a uniform
dress to be worn by letter carriers, and any person
not connected with the letter carrier branch of the
Postal Service who shall wear the uniform which may
be prescribed shall for every such offense be punishable
by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars,
or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or
both.</p>

<p>Letter carriers and substitutes must procure uniforms
at their own expense. Postmasters will advise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and assist them in obtaining well-fitting suits of the
prescribed material and at the best terms.</p>

<p>Uniforms made according to the following specifications
must be worn by all letter carriers:</p>


<h3>For Winter Uniform.</h3>

<p>Coat.&mdash;A double-breasted, square-corner sack coat,
with lapels, and made of bluish-gray worsted or serge,
terminating two-thirds of the distance from the top
of the hipbone to the knee, with a pocket at each side
and one on the left breast, all outside, with flaps 2-3/4
to 3 inches wide, with length to suit height of wearer,
say, 6-1/2 to 7 inches; coat to be piped with the best
grade mohair braid, 1/16 inch projecting, to be inserted
between edges; ten brass buttons with the design
of this Department (letter carrier in uniform,
with mail bag on shoulder and letter in uplifted hand,
or present design with letters “P. O. D.” beneath),
down the front to button to the neck, and cord piping
around the sleeves, 2-1/2 inches from the bottom,
to correspond with piping on the edge; two circular
buttons (vest size) on sleeve of coat, equidistant below
cord on sleeve; on right shoulder a brass hook
1-1/2 inches long by 3/4 inch wide, to be two inches
above sleeve seam, to retain strap of mail bag in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
position; coat to be lined with a durable all-wool
flannel.</p>

<p>Trousers.&mdash;Of same material and color of coat, with
fine black broadcloth piping, 1/4 inch wide, down the
outside seam. Side and two hip pockets, to be made of
strong, durable material.</p>

<p>Vest.&mdash;A single-breasted vest of same material and
color as coat and trousers, with seven circular, brass
buttons (vest size), with the letters “P. O. D.” upon
the face. Four pockets on outside, two on breast, and
two at waist, and one on inside.</p>

<p>Overcoat or Cape.&mdash;A reversible cape (detached
from the coat) reaching to the cuff of the coat sleeve
when the arm is extended, of the same material and
color on one side, and gutta-percha cloth on the other
side, with five buttons, the same as on the coat, down
the front, and bound entirely round with black mohair
piping; or an overcoat of the same material and
color, trimmed to correspond with the coat, with five
brass buttons down the front of the same size and
design as the coat button. It shall not be obligatory
on the carriers to wear either, but whenever additional
covering is needed the postmaster of each city will
decide, in accordance with the wishes of the majority
of the carriers, which shall be worn, as both must not
be worn in the same city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>


<h3>For Summer Wear.</h3>

<p>Coat.&mdash;Single-breasted, straight-front sack, with
square corners, skeleton made, of bluish-gray flannel,
or a light-weight bluish-gray worsted or serge, and
terminating two-thirds distance from top of hipbone
to knee, with lapels (medium roll) made to button
over the breast; three pockets outside, with flaps, one
on each side and one on left breast. Coat to be bound
with black mohair piping, 1/16 inch projection, and
five buttons down front, four buttons to button, and
one at top, under lapel of coat.</p>

<p>Trousers.&mdash;Same material and color as coat, with

durable material.</p>

<p>Vest.&mdash;Same material and color as coat and trousers,
piped same as coat, with collar cut to open same height
as coat, and five regulation buttons down the front.
Vest may be omitted in Summer. During the heated
term postmasters may permit letter carriers to wear
a neat shirt or loose-fitting blouse, instead of coat and
vest, the same to be made of light-gray chambray,
gingham, light-gray cheviot, or other light-gray
washable material, to be worn with turn-down collar,
dark tie, and neat belt, all to be uniform at each office.
All garments must be sewed with pure-dye sewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
silk, and the garments must be finished in a proper
and workmanlike manner and goods thoroughly
shrunk.</p>

<p>Carriers must be designated by number, and nickel-plated
figures nine-sixteenths of an inch in length, surmounted
by a metallic wreath, must be worn, on the
hat, cap, or helmet, the design and pattern to be uniform
at all offices, and to be regarded as a part of the

<p>Twenty-five years’ service, one silver star.</p>

<p>Thirty years’ service, two silver stars.</p>

<p>Forty years’ service, two gold stars.</p>

<p>All stars will be three-fourths of an inch in diameter
and placed one-half inch above black braid on each
sleeve, equidistant between seams.</p>

<p>Postmasters of free delivery offices will cause a careful
inspection of carriers’ uniforms to be made twice
a year. A carrier should not be required to buy a new
suit or any part thereof, unless the postmaster, after
inspection, decides that it is necessary in order to
maintain a uniform and neat appearance of the force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>


<h3>Performance of Service.</h3>

<p>All letter carriers at free delivery offices shall be
entitled to leave of absence, not to exceed fifteen days
in each year, without loss of pay. The words “each
year” mean fiscal year (July 1st to June 30th, inclusive),
and carriers in the service on the first day of
July are entitled to receive fifteen days’ vacation, inclusive
of Sundays and holidays, at any time during
the year when the postmaster can best spare them.
Carriers entering the service after the first day of July
are entitled to a pro rata leave of absence during the
remainder of the fiscal year, equal to one and a quarter
days for each month.</p>

<p>Carriers serving as members of the local Civil Service
Boards during examinations, as members of the
United States Militia of the District of Columbia, or
as witnesses for the Government in the United States
courts, shall be given leave with full pay during necessary
absence occasioned by such service.</p>

<p>Postmasters may, in addition to the leave of absence
provided by law, grant a leave of absence without pay
to carriers in cases of illness, disability received in the
service, or other urgent necessity, such leave not to
exceed thirty days. An application for a leave of
absence to cover a longer period of time must be made
to the First Assistant Postmaster General (Division of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Free Delivery) for suspension with loss of pay, or for
removal from the service, as the circumstances may
require.</p>

<p>When regular carriers are absent from duty for any
cause, their places shall be supplied by substitute carriers.
The Postmaster General is authorized to employ,
when necessary, during the time such fifteen
days’ leave of absence is granted to a letter carrier,
such number of substitute letter carriers as may be
deemed advisable, who shall be paid for the services
rendered at the rate of six hundred dollars per annum.</p>

<p>Substitute carriers shall be assigned to duty by the
postmaster, or his representative, and must never be
called into service by carriers, except in cases of urgent
necessity, when it is plainly impossible to notify the
postmaster in time, either by telephone or messenger.</p>

<p>Substitute letter carriers will be paid one dollar per
annum, payable quarterly. They also receive pay at
the rate of $600 per annum when serving in place of
carriers who have been granted annual leave of absence.
The pro rata salary of carriers for whom they
serve who are absent without pay is also given to
them, as well as the pro rata salary of carriers who
are granted leave of absence with full pay in order
that they may serve as members of local Civil Service
Boards in conducting examinations, as witnesses for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the Government in United States courts, or as members
of the United States Militia of the District of
Columbia.</p>

<p>When substitutes serve for regular carriers on Sunday
and perform the same amount of work the regular
carrier would have performed on that day, they
receive a full day’s pay.</p>


<h3>Hours of Service for Carriers.</h3>

<p>Eight hours constitutes a day’s work for letter carriers
in cities or postal districts connected therewith,
for which they receive the same pay as is paid for a
day’s work of a greater number of hours. If any letter
carrier is employed a greater number of hours per
day than eight he is paid extra for the same in proportion
to the salary fixed by law.</p>

<p>Postmasters prepare, for the guidance of carriers
in their work, a time schedule made on the basis of
eight hours’ work each day, and so arranged as to
provide only such time as is absolutely necessary for
the legitimate office duties of each carrier. The hours
of daily service need not be consecutive. No carrier
is scheduled for more work than he can perform during
eight hours. Carriers need not be required to consume
exactly eight hours each day, but as nearly such
time as practicable, considering the varying amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
mail to be handled on different days. Postmasters
must not direct or permit carriers to work overtime,
and are held accountable therefor.</p>

<p>Letter carriers must not report prior to schedule
time for the first trip of the day, nor for the beginning
of a trip following a “swing.” Carriers must not remain
at their desks nor in the working room of the office
during a “swing” or interval between trips, nor
during the dinner hour; neither must they remain in
the post office after completing the last trip of the
day.</p>

<p>Carriers engaged exclusively in the collection service
must not remain in the workroom of the office
except while depositing and facing the mail collected
by them. Carriers must register on the automatic
clock register upon reporting, leaving, returning and
ending for each trip which begins and ends at the post
office. The time from the clock tapes is copied into
the time book or pasted into a suitable book and preserved,
and constitutes the official record of time.
Should the clock register be out of order the time
recorded by carriers on their daily trip reports is entered
in the time book. One carrier must not register
on the clock for another. If this rule is violated both
the carriers concerned will be removed.</p>

<p>The time of reporting, leaving, returning and ending
for each trip must also be recorded by the carriers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
on their daily trip reports; the entries on these reports
must be made at the beginning and end of each trip,
and must not be deferred until the close of the day.
When collections are made in the morning, on the carrier’s
way to the office, the first and second entries on
the trip report must be the time of opening the first
box. When a carrier completes his delivery on his
route and does not return to the post office the time
recorded on his trip report for returning and ending
on that trip must be the time of his last piece of mail.</p>

<p>Where carriers are unable to deliver all mail matter
taken out on the last trip of the day without making
overtime, they must return to the post office within the
eight hours prescribed with the understanding that
they make a full report to the superintendent of the
station, and a full statement will also be made on the
trip report of the day. Carriers are required to deliver
all mail taken out on the earlier trips, even though
such delivery necessitates exceeding the time allowed
by the schedules for such trips, unless collections are
made for an important dispatch, in which event the
latter must be met and mail remaining undelivered will
be delivered on the following trip.</p>

<p>Every letter carrier must keep a route book, which
should be a complete directory of the persons served
by him, and all changes of address should be posted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
daily. Carriers must record daily in their log books
the disposition made of all undelivered mail. The forwarding
of mail, and notifying publishers of changes
of address is clerical work, and should not be performed
by carriers.</p>

<p>Carriers are not permitted to perform clerical work.
Their work must be confined to the collection and
delivery of mail; the routing of mail for delivery;
the making up or “logging” of undelivered matter; receipting
for and the recording of registered mail; posting
route books; the facing of mail collected by them,
and, at offices where hand-feed canceling machines
are used, the facing of mail directly into such machines,
and to duty at carriers’ delivery windows.</p>

<p>In the performance of their duties letter carriers
must be civil, prompt and obliging. Carriers must
attend quietly and diligently to their duties, and under
no circumstances must they loiter or stop to converse
on their routes, and they must refrain from loud talking,
profane language, and smoking in the office or on
their routes.</p>

<p>Carriers must not solicit, in person or through others,
contributions of money, gifts, or presents; issue
addresses, complimentary cards, prints, publications,
or any substitute therefor intended or calculated to
induce the public to make them gifts or presents; distribute,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
offer for sale, or collect the proceeds of the
sale of tickets to theatres, balls, concerts, fairs, or any
other entertainment; issue for profit souvenirs or postal
handbooks, or in any manner co-operate with or
assist the publishers of souvenirs or postal handbooks
to secure the patronage of the public; compile city directories
for public use or assist publishers to compile
the same; borrow money from patrons on their routes;
or contract debts which they have no reasonable prospect
of being able to pay.</p>

<p>Carriers must not engage in any business during
their prescribed hours of service, or conduct any business
after hours which offers the temptation to solicit
patronage on their routes, or which, by reason of their
position in the Government service, gives them special
advantage over competitors, such as book canvassing,
soliciting insurance, selling sewing machines, or
other kindred occupations.</p>

<p>Letter carriers may be reprimanded, suspended with
loss of pay, or removed from the service for infractions
of the Postal Laws and Regulations, of orders of
the Department, and of orders of postmasters not inconsistent
therewith, as the nature or gravity of the
offenses may require. All reprimands and suspensions
must be reported to the First Assistant Postmaster
General (Division of Free Delivery) for approval and
entry in the carriers’ efficiency record.</p>

<span class="fs90 bold">DELIVERY AND COLLECTING OF MAIL BY CARRIERS.</span></h2>


<p>The regulations as to the delivery of mail matter
will apply to the delivery of such matter by letter
carriers, except where inapplicable or as otherwise
modified.</p>

<p>Carriers must be careful to deliver mail to the persons
for whom it is intended, or to some one authorized
to receive it. They will, in case of doubt, make
inquiry with the view of ascertaining the owner. Failing
in this, the mail will be returned to the office, to be
disposed of as the postmaster may direct. Carriers
must not deliver mail matter to patrons in the street,
unless such delivery can be made without unreasonable
delay. Mail matter must not be delivered by
carriers in boxes or other receptacles which are not
occupied in whole or in part by the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'adressees unless'">addressees unless</ins>
expressly ordered by the postmaster.</p>

<p>Carriers must not throw mail matter into windows
or halls, unless specially instructed to do so. They
must ring the bell, wait a reasonable time for an
answer, and deliver the mail to some one of the household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
in the habit of receiving it. Patrons who repeatedly
fail to respond promptly to the carrier’s ring
must be reported to the postmaster. Carriers must
not enter any house while on their trips, except in the
discharge of their official duties. Mail matter must
not be delivered by carriers which has not passed
through the post office or station with which they
are connected. Mail matter intrusted to carriers must
not be exhibited to persons other than those addressed,
except on the order of the postmaster or some one
authorized to act for him. Letters for delivery must
not be carried by carriers in their pockets. Carriers
must not deviate from the respective routes. Carriers
must not stop for their meals while on their trips.
Carriers must not throw away or improperly dispose
of mail matter, however trifling or unimportant it may
appear to them. Stamps must not be removed from
mail matter of any class whatever intrusted to carriers
for delivery or collected by them for mailing.</p>

<p>Mounted carriers must dismount and deliver the
mail at the doors of residences, except in cases where
the patrons on their routes consent to respond to their
call and receive the mail <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'at the sidwalk'">at the sidewalk</ins>. Carriers are
not required to deliver mail at residences where vicious
dogs are permitted to run at large. Persons keeping
such dogs must call at the post office for their mail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Carriers must collect and promptly return to the
postmaster all postage due on mail intrusted to them
for delivery, as indicated by the postage-due stamps
attached. Such mail matter must not be delivered
until the postage due shall have been paid.</p>

<p>When carriers making collections from letter boxes
find that it will be impossible on any one trip to carry
to the post office the contents of all the boxes on their
routes, preference must be given to mail matter of the
first class. Newspapers and packages placed on the
tops of letter boxes should be collected when it can
be done without overloading the mail sacks and preventing
the prompt collection of mail matter properly
deposited in the boxes.</p>

<p>Carriers must, while on their routes, receive letters
with postage stamps affixed, handed them for mailing,
but they should not delay the deliveries by waiting for
such letters. Money to pay postage on letters handed
them for mailing must not be accepted, except as provided
for in the use of the stamp-selling envelope in
connection with house-to-house delivery and collection
boxes.</p>

<p>Carriers should also receive other small articles of
mailable matter with postage properly prepaid, but
they should refuse to receive packages that are cumbersome
on account of size, shape or weight, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
when the carrying of such packages would interfere
with the prompt delivery of mail and the collections
from letter boxes.</p>

<p>Carriers must receive and register all letters and
packages of first-class matter that are not cumbersome
on account of size, shape or weight, and properly
offered them for registration, and must give the regulation
receipt therefor. Carriers must encourage the
registration of valuable first-class matter by patrons
on their routes.</p>

<p>Postmasters may permit carriers to sell postage
stamps or stamped envelopes in limited quantities; but
their deliveries or collections must not be delayed
in making change.</p>

<p>Carriers must not return, under any circumstances,
to any person, any letter or letters, said to have been
deposited in a letter box, or which have come into the
custody of the carrier in a regular way. An applicant
for the return of such mail should be directed to the
postmaster.</p>

<p>After the last daily delivery carriers must return
to the post office or station with which they are connected
their satchels and all mail that can not be delivered.
Carriers may be permitted to take their
satchels home with them direct from their routes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
when, in the opinion of the postmaster, the interests
of the service will be promoted thereby, but undelivered
mail matter remaining in satchels must first
be deposited in the nearest letter box.</p>

<span class="fs90 bold">SPECIAL DELIVERY MESSENGERS.</span></h2>

<h3>Chance for Boys from Thirteen Years of Age to<br />
Enter Post Office Service.</h3>


<p>The Postmaster General may, in his discretion, require
the delivery of special delivery matter to be made
entirely by special messengers. In New York City,
however, this is done solely by employes in the service.
At free delivery offices postmasters will, from
time to time, employ as many messengers as in their
judgment may be necessary to secure prompt delivery
of special matter. None but trustworthy boys over 13
years of age should be employed. The force of special
delivery messengers in each office should be so arranged
that a suitable number may always be on hand
to secure immediate delivery of all special delivery
matter at any time within the prescribed hour of the
day.</p>

<p>Each messenger, before entering upon his duties,
must take the oath prescribed by law on the blank
furnished. Substitute letter carriers, when not on
duty in place of regular carriers, may be employed as
messengers in the special delivery service, and receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the same compensation as other messengers; but such
employment must not interfere with the work of the
post office or free delivery.</p>

<p>Where delivery of special delivery matter can not
be promptly made by regular special delivery messengers,
postmasters may cause such delivery to be made
by any regular clerk or employe, who will be allowed
the same compensation, and be paid and give receipt
therefore in the same manner as regular messengers.</p>

<p>Any person employed to make immediate delivery
of letters or other mail matter, shall be deemed an employee
of the Postal Service, whether he may have been
sworn or not, or temporarily or permanently employed,
and as such employee shall be liable to any penalties
or punishments provided by law for the improper detention,
delay, secretion, rifling, embezzlement, purloining
or destruction of any letter or other article of mail
matter, or the contents thereof, intrusted to him for
delivery or placed in his custody.</p>

<p>Combinations or arrangements between special delivery
messengers with a view to securing a division
of the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'total permissable'">total permissible</ins> compensation of the month
are forbidden; and postmasters should, by distribution
of work and assignment of hours of duty, equalize as
far as practicable the compensation of messengers. A
messenger should not always be assigned to duty during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the same periods of each day; but changes will be
made from time to time, whereby a messenger employed
during the busy hours of one day may be assigned
to the duller hours of another day.</p>

<p>Orderly conduct of special delivery messengers while
in the office and on their trips is strictly enforced; and
no messenger will be retained who is not diligent and
well-behaved. A special place is provided in the post
office for the accommodation of the messengers, and it
is so arranged as to prevent their access to other parts
of the office, and to mail matter other than that in
which they are immediately concerned.</p>

<p>Special delivery messengers need not be uniformed,
except in such special cases as may be ordered, but
they should all be decently and comfortably clad. Substitute
letter-carriers, when employed as messengers
for special delivery, may wear their carrier uniforms.</p>

<p>Messengers are paid at the rate of not exceeding
eight cents for each piece delivered, or attempted to
be delivered.</p>

<p>Each messenger is furnished with a delivery book,
in which must be entered the number and address of
each piece of matter received for delivery, the date
and hour of its receipt by the messenger, and the
amount of postage due thereon. The receipt of the
person to whom any special delivery matter is delivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
must be taken in the blank space provided for this
purpose in the delivery book. Delivery books will be
kept in the post office when not in use, and messengers
must promptly return them to the office after every
tour. Whenever for any cause a book is no longer
used, it will be filed in the post office.</p>

<p>A former learned wit of the Post Office Department,
cogitating over, upon, under, and between, the multifarious
and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'abstruce problems'">abstruse problems</ins> submitted for adjudication,
evolved the following gems of keen, mental penetration.
That:</p>

<p>Feather beds are not mailable.</p>

<p>A stamp of the foot is not sufficient to carry a letter.</p>

<p>A pair of onions will go for two cents.</p>

<p>Persons are compelled to lick their own postage
stamps; the postmaster cannot be compelled to do this.</p>

<p>Nitro-glycerine must be forwarded at the risk of
the sender. If it should blow up in the postmaster’s
hands he cannot be held responsible.</p>

<p>When candy is sent through the mails it is earnestly
requested that both ends of the package be left open,
so that the employees of the post office may test its
quality.</p>

<p>John Smith gets his mail from 674,279 post offices,
hence a letter directed to John Smith, United States,

<p>Poems on “Spring, Spring, the Beautiful Spring,”
and “The Beautiful Snow, with its White Efulgent
Glow,” are rigidly excluded from the mails. (This is
to catch the editorial vote).</p>

<p>It is earnestly requested that lovers writing to their
sweethearts will please confine their gushing rhapsodies
to the inside of the envelope.</p>

<p>Ducks cannot be sent through the mails alive. Their
discordant, vociferous greetings are apt to disturb the
slumbers of the clerks.</p>

mails; clerks are known to have a weakness for such
things.</p>

<span class="fs90 bold">DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.</span></h2>

<h3>A Declaration by the Representatives of the United<br />
States of America, in Congress Assembled.</h3>


<p>When, in the course of human events, it becomes
necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands
which have connected them with another, and to assume,
among the powers of the earth, the separate and
equal station to which the laws of nature and of
nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions
of mankind requires that they should declare the
causes which impel them to the separation.</p>

<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident&mdash;that all men
are created equal; that they are endowed by their
Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among
these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
That, to secure these rights, governments are instituted
among men, deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed; that, whenever any form of
government becomes destructive of these ends, it is
the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute
a new government, laying its foundations on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
such principles, and organizing its powers in such
form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate
that governments long established should not be
changed for light and transient causes; and, accordingly,
all experience hath shown that mankind are
more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than
to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which
they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses
and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object,
evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism,
it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such
government, and to provide new guards for their future
security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these
colonies, and such is now the necessity which constrains
them to alter their former systems of government.
The history of the present king of Great Britain
is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations,
all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute
tyranny over these States. To prove this, let
facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>1. He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome
and necessary for the public good.</p>

<p>2. He has forbidden his government to pass laws
of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended
in their operations till his assent should be obtained;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and, when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to
attend to them.</p>

<p>3. He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation
of large districts of people, unless those
people would relinquish the right of representation in
the Legislature&mdash;a right inestimable to them, and formidable
to tyrants only.</p>

<p>4. He has called together legislative bodies at places
unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the repository
of their public records, for the sole purpose of
fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p>

<p>5. He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly,
for opposing, with manly firmness, his invasions
on the rights of the people.</p>

<p>6. He has refused, for a long time after such dissolutions,
to cause others to be elected, whereby the
legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned
to the people at large for their exercise; the
State remaining, in the meantime, exposed to the
dangers of invasions from without, and convulsions
within.</p>

<p>7. He has endeavored to prevent the population of
these States; for that purpose obstructing the laws for
the naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others
to encourage their migration hither, and raising the
conditions of new appropriations of lands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>8. He has obstructed the administration of justice,
by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary
powers.</p>

<p>9. He has made judges dependent on his will
alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount
and payment of their salaries.</p>

<p>10. He has erected a multitude of new offices, and
sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and
eat out their substance.</p>

<p>11. He has kept among us in times of peace, standing
armies, without the consent of our Legislatures.</p>

<p>12. He has affected to render the military independent
of, and superior to, the civil power.</p>

<p>13. He has combined with others to subject us to
a jurisdiction foreign to our constitutions, and unacknowledged
by our laws; giving his assent to their
acts of pretended legislation:&mdash;</p>

<p>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among
us;</p>

<p>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment
for any murders which they should commit on
the inhabitants of these States;</p>

<p>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world;</p>

<p>For imposing taxes on us without our consent;</p>

<p>For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of
a trial by jury;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>For transporting us beyond seas, to be tried for pretended
offences;</p>

<p>For abolishing the free system of English laws in
a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary
government, and enlarging its boundaries, so as
to render it at once an example and fit instrument for
introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies;</p>

<p>For taking away our charters, abolishing our most
valuable laws, and altering, fundamentally, the forms
of our governments;</p>

<p>For suspending our own Legislatures and declaring
themselves invested with power to legislate for us in
all cases whatsoever.</p>

<p>14. He has abdicated government here, by declaring
us out of his protection and waging war against us.</p>

<p>15. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts,
burned our towns and destroyed the lives of our people.</p>

<p>16. He is at this time transporting large armies of
foreign mercenaries to complete the works of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'death, desolution'">death,
desolation</ins> and tyranny, already begun with circumstances
of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in
the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the
head of a civilized nation.</p>

<p>17. He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken
captive on the high seas, to bear arms against their
country, to become the executioners of their friends
and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>18. He has excited domestic insurrection among
us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants
of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose
known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction
of all ages, sexes and conditions.</p>

<p>In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned
for redress in the most humble terms; our repeated
petitions have been answered only by repeated
injury. A prince whose character is thus marked by
every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the
ruler of a free people.</p>

<p>Nor have we been wanting in our attentions to our
British brethren. We have warned them, from time
to time, of attempts by their Legislature to extend an
unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded
them of the circumstances of our emigration and
settlement here. We have appealed to their native
justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them
by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these
usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections
and correspondence. They, too, have been
deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We
must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces
our separation, and hold them as we hold the
rest of mankind&mdash;enemies in war; in peace, friends.</p>

<p>We, therefore, the representatives of the United
States of America in general Congress assembled, appealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude
of our intentions, do, in the name and by the
authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly
publish and declare that these united colonies are,
and of right ought to be, free and independent States;
that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British
crown, and that all political connection between
them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to
be, totally dissolved, and that, as free and independent
States, they have full power to levy war, conclude
peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and do
all other acts and things which independent States
may of right do. And for the support of this declaration,
with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine
Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives,
our fortunes, and our sacred honor.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
